Hi, I'm Gloria 👋 
------------------------
I'm a (partly) self-taught and wanna-be Front-End Developer who is creating its own Portfolio on GitHub in order to make it easier for recruiters to check my abilities on real projects.

I studied the following codes:<br>
◼️​ HMTL5;<br>
◼️​ CSS3;<br>
◼️​ Bootstrap 5;<br>
◼️​ Javascript;<br>
◼️​ Vue.js.<br>

I decided to take this path because I like the fact to use logic and specific instructions together with creativity to create impressive and responsive designs 🖼️.

Check what I can create to see if I'm perfect for you! ✨​
